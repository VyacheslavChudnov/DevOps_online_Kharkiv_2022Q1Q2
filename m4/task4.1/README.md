## Part 1
***
___Exercise 1.___ _Log in to the system as root (or sudo-er)._

![Login](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/001_Login.jpg)
***
___Exercise 2.___ _Use the passwd command to change the password. Examine the basic parameters
of the command. What system file does it change *?_

![Change password](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/002_Change_password.jpg)

### Command passwd has many options:
```
  -a, --all                     report password status on all accounts
  -d, --delete                  delete the password for the named account
  -e, --expire                  force expire the password for the named account
  -h, --help                    display this help message and exit
  -k, --keep-tokens             change password only if expired
  -i, --inactive INACTIVE       set password inactive after expiration to INACTIVE
  -l, --lock                    lock the password of the named account
  -n, --mindays MIN_DAYS        set minimum number of days before password change to MIN_DAYS
  -q, --quiet                   quiet mode
  -r, --repository REPOSITORY   change password in REPOSITORY repository
  -R, --root CHROOT_DIR         directory to chroot into
  -S, --status                  report password status on the named account
  -u, --unlock                  unlock the password of the named account
  -w, --warndays WARN_DAYS      set expiration warning days to WARN_DAYS
  -x, --maxdays MAX_DAYS        set maximum number of days before password change to MAX_DAYS
```
Changing the password changes the **/etc/shadow** system file which contains the passwords hash
***
___Exercise 3.___ _Determine the users registered in the system, as well as  what commands they
execute. What additional information can be gleaned from the command execution?_

Command **who** determines users registered in the system and command **w** shows what command they execute.
Also these commands show login and idle time and IP address if user connect from network.
***
___Exercise 4.___ _Change personal information about yourself._

Command **chfn** allows change personal information about user (name, phone, office and etc.)
***
___Exercise 5.___ _Become familiar with the Linux help system and the man and info commands.
Get help on the previously discussed commands, define and describe any two keys
for these commands. Give examples._
```
Commands **help** **man** and **info** are Linux help system commands
Command **help** is a bash command. It uses internal bash structures to store and retrieve information about bash commands.
Command **man** is typically a single page that contains all information.
Command **info** is more structured and is composed of multiple pages that you can browse through using links.
```
Examples Linux help system commands:
```
$ man --help
```
![$ man help](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/003_man_help.jpg)
```
$ info man
```
![$ info man](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/004_info_man.jpg)
```
$ man info
```
![$ man info](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/005_man_info.jpg)

For searching by keyword you'd use parameter -k:
```
$ man -k passwd
```
![$ man -k passwd](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/006_man_passwd.jpg)

To read man about file /etc/passwd (not about command passwd), youâ€™d use section number:
```
$ man 5 passwd
```
![$ man 5 passwd](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/007_man_5_passwd.jpg)
***

files .bash* using commands._

Usind command **less**

![command less](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/008_less.jpg)

Usind command **more**

![command more](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/009_more.jpg)
***
___Exercise 7.___ _Determine  the  last  logon  time  for  all  users.  Tip:  You  should  read  the
documentation for the finger command._

Usind command **finger**

![$ finger -lmsp](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/010_finger.jpg)
***
___Exercise 8.___ _List the contents of the home directory using the ls command, define its files
and  directories.  Hint:  Use  the  help  system  to  familiarize  yourself  with  the  ls command_

Usind command **ls**

![comman ls](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/011_ls.jpg)
***

## Part 2

___Exercise 1.___ _Examine the tree command. Master the technique of applying a template, for
example, display all files that contain a character c, or files that contain a specific
sequence of characters. List subdirectories of the root directory up to and including
the second nesting level_

Examine the **tree** command

![command tree](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/012_tree.jpg)
***
___Exercise 2.___ _What command can be used to determine the type of file (for example, text or
binary)? Give an example._

For determine the type of file use command **file**:
```
$ file text.txt
text.txt: ASCII text

$ file /home/slava
/home/slava: directory
```
***
___Exercise 3.___ _Master the skills of navigating the file system using relative and absolute paths.
How can you go back to your home directory from anywhere in the filesystem?_

We can use **cd /home/user** command for absolute path or **cd user** command using relative path if we are in the folder **/home**
For return in the home directory from from anywhere in the filesystem we can use command **cd** or **cd~**
***
___Exercise 4.___ _Become familiar with the various options for the ls command. Give examples of
listing  directories  using  different  keys.  Explain  the  information  displayed  on  the
terminal using the -l and -a switches._

Usind command **ls**

![comman ls](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/011_ls.jpg)
***
___Exercise 5.___ _Perform the following sequence of operations:
- create a subdirectory in the home directory;
- in this subdirectory create a file containing information about directories located in
  the root directory (using I/O redirection operations);
- view the created file;
- copy the created file to your home directory using relative and absolute addressing;
- delete the previously created subdirectory with the file requesting removal;
- delete the file copied to the home directory._

Creating a subdirectory in the home directory:
```
slava@ubnvm1:~$ mkdir test
```
Creating a file containing information about directories located in the root directory (using I/O redirection operations):
```
slava@ubnvm1:~/test$ tree / -d -L 1 -o roottree.txt
slava@ubnvm1:~/test$ nano roottree.txt
```
Copyng the created file to your home directory using relative and absolute addressing:
```
slava@ubnvm1:~/test$ cp roottree.txt /home/slava/roottree.txt
slava@ubnvm1:~$ cp test/roottree.txt roottree.txt
```
Deleting the previously created subdirectory with the file requesting removal:
```
slava@ubnvm1:~$ rm -r -i test
```
Deleting the file copied to the home directory:
```
slava@ubnvm1:~$ rm roottree.txt
```
***
___Exercise 6.___ _Perform the following sequence of operations:
- create a subdirectory **test** in the home directory;
- copy the **.bash_history** file to this directory while changing its name to **labwork2**;
- create a hard and soft link to the **labwork2** file in the test subdirectory;
- how to define soft and hard link, what do these concepts;
- change the data by opening a symbolic link. What changes will happen and why;
- rename the hard link file to **hard_lnk_labwork2**;
- rename the soft link file to **symb_lnk_labwork2** file;
- then delete the **labwork2**. What changes have occurred and why?_

Creating a subdirectory test in the home directory:
```
slava@ubnvm1:~$ mkdir test
```
Copying the .bash_history file to this directory while changing its name to labwork2:
```
slava@ubnvm1:~$ cp .bash_history /home/slava/test/labwork2
```
Creating a hard and soft link to the labwork2 file in the test subdirectory

![command ln](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/013_ln.jpg)

Hard link is just another name for the original file. If you delete one of these files (more precisely one of these names), then the file is 
still saved on disk (as long as it has at least one link name).

Soft link is just a link to the original file. If the original file is deleted, the symbolic link is not removed, but is useless.
Unlike hard links, symbolic links can point to files located in a different file system, such as a mountable medium, or even on another computer.

Changing the data by opening a symbolic link will change original file because Hard link and Soft link connect with original file.

Renaming the hard link file to **hard_lnk_labwork2**:
**slava@ubnvm1:~/test$ mv link_on_labwork2 hard_lnk_labwork2**

Renaming the soft link file to **symb_lnk_labwork2** file:
**slava@ubnvm1:~/test$ mv softlink_on_labwork2 symb_lnk_labwork2**

Deleting the labwork2:
**slava@ubnvm1:~/test$ rm labwork2**

Command **ls** shows **symb_lnk_labwork2** now light red because useless.

___Exercise 8.___ _Determine which partitions are mounted in the system, as well as the types of
these partitions._

![partitions](https://github.com/VyacheslavChudnov/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2/blob/main/m4/task4.1/screenshots_for_task4.1/015_partitions.jpg)
***
___Exercise 9.___ _Count the number of lines containing a given sequence of characters in a given
file._

Countig the number of lines containing a sequence of **2** in a **test222.txt** file:
**slava@ubnvm1:~$ grep 2 test222.txt | wc -l**
***
___Exercise 10.___ _Using the **find** command, find all files in the /etc directory containing the **host**
character sequence._

```
slava@ubnvm1:/$ find /etc -maxdepth 1 -name *host*
```
***
___Exercise 11.___ _List all objects in /etc that contain the ss character sequence. How can I duplicate
a similar command using a bunch of **grep**?_

Listing all objects in /etc that contain the **ss** character sequence:
```
slava@ubnvm1:/etc$ ls -d *ss
```

Listing all objects in /etc that contain the **ss** character sequence using **grep**:
```
slava@ubnvm1:/etc$ ls | grep ss
```
***
___Exercise 12.___ _Organize a screen-by-screen print of the contents of the /etc directory. Hint: You
must use stream redirection operations._
```
slava@ubnvm1:/etc$ ls -l > /home/slava/test/out.txt
```
***
___Exercise 13.___ _What are the types of devices and how to determine the type of device? Give
examples._
