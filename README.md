It was my first introduction to Git.

I created account on github and Installed git on the laptop.

I created new repo DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2022Q1Q2.

Than I created some folders and files and made commit.

I created some branches made change in some files made merge and resolved conflict.

I realized that git is a powerfull version control system for collaborating developers.
